# Rick & Morty App/Widget

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run the widget

First of all widget need to be started:  
`npm run start`

By default it runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
<br/>
<br/>
After that it can be embed on any website by passing:  
`<iframe src="http://localhost:3000" style="border: none;" width="50%" height="70%"></iframe>`

You can pass width and height properties whatever you like, but for the best experience please use prefilled values or higher.
<br/>
<br/>
To work the widget as expected, please put `iframe` into div with `height` property at least 90vh.
<br/>
<br/>
Here you go :)
